The `dhcp-container` project goal is to create a containerized version
of the ISC DHCP service suitable for use on container servers like
Fedora CoreOS or any system capable of running Podman Quadlet services.

toc::[]

== Overview

This includes two different implementations.  The first is built on a
Fedora base image and uses the standard package management techniques
to add the DHCP service binaries. This is a testbed to determine the
additional configuration and volume parameters needed to supply the
DHCP daemon.

The second variation is a minimalized image, containing only files
required for the `dhcpd` binary to operate within the container.

This minimization is achieved by selecting the required binaries and
then examining them for shared library bindings. The packages
containing these libraries are located and unpacked, and the required
files copied into the container tree with the binary. The final result
is a container image containing no unneeded or unused files.

The the build process is created and tested on Fedora CoreOS x86_64
and aarch64 systems and produces a working container for each
architecture. The build process should port easily to other systems
that support `podman` and `buildah`. The resulting container image
should run on any system using a OCI compliant container runtime.

== Usage

On a DHCP server host, all of the active interfaces must be configured
with a static IP address.

The current container cannot serve IPv6 addresses

=== Configuration Files

* `/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf`
* `/var/lib/dhcpd/dhcpd.leases`

=== Container Unit File

Containerized services are defined for https://systemd.io/[`systemd`]
by a
https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-systemd.unit.5.html[podman
systemd unit] file. This file provides the parameters needed to start
and stop the container and to manage it like any other service.

On distributions based on Fedora, podman and systemd-podman are
installed by default. On Debian based systems after version 12
(bookworm) the `systemd-container` package may need to be installed to
enable systemd containers.

To add and enable a new systemd container service, place the unit file
in `/etc/containers/systemd` and reload the services:

   sudo cp `dhcpd.container` /etc/containers/systemd
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl status dhcpd

.systemctl status dhcpd

== Container Creation - Buildah

https://buildah.io[`buildah`] is an ideal tool for building very
finely crafted container images. Buildah *can* make use of
conventional Dockerfiles with base images that are essentially an OS
container with software installer tools and shells and other support
files. Buildah is capable of creating very light-weight containers,
with as little as a single binary and no base image. Buildah also
gives fine control of the container image layering, eliminating the
need for conventions like package installer cache cleanup steps after
each package installation step. With Buildah you can specify precisely
what goes into each layer of each image.

== OS Based Image

The easy step is to create an image based on a well-known distribution
base image. Then the process is just to install the distro
`dhcp-server` package, open volumes and ports and define the startup
command. If the resulting instance is well-behaved, it can be used as
the image for a *quadlet*, a systemd service run from a
container. This is the conventional service container image creation
method. At the end, the container definition wihttps://www.amazon.com/ll contain all of the
elements needed to run the service.

== Scratch Image

At this point we have an image that runs the service as desired. What
remains is to reduce the size of the image until it contains only
files that are required for operation. The obvious things are the
files contained in the packages installed over the base image, but the
base image usually provides support components like standard shared
libraries. While it might be possible to weed out the unneeded files,
there are well defined ways to determine exactly which files are
required. With those techniques it is possible to start at the
critical binaries, to interrogate them for their requirements and to
work your way up the chain until the service works and every file can
be confirmed to be critical to operation.

== Future

ISC DHCPD discontinued support of the last release, version 4.4 at the
end of 2022.  https://www.isc.org/dhcphistory/[ISC DHCP 1.0 was
released in June 1998] and it has been mantained and extended
continuously since then. At that time it was still common for
developers to create custom configuration syntax and parsers merely
because there was no agreed-upon standard for structured data. The
system data was stored in memory or in local files for
persistance. Database hooks were added over time as ad-hoc updates.

In ISC has re-implemented modern DHCP services in the
https://www.isc.org/kea/[Kea Project]. Kea replaces the archaic
configuration format with a standard JSON format and schema. It
includes alternate database back ends as a standard feature. Kea
implements a well defined REST api for integrated management and
operation.
